Task 2

Write a method modifyStrings() that takes in three given strings S, S1, and S2 consisting of different numbers of characters respectively, the task is to modify the string S by replacing all the substrings S1 with the string S2 in the string S and printing the modified string S.

Sample Input
Sample Output
Explanation
S = "abababa"
S1 = "aba" 
S2 = "a"

modifyStrings(S, S1, S2);
aba
Changing the substrings S[0, 2](Referring to characters from the 0th index of S till the 2nd index of S and S[4, 6] (= S1) to the string S2 (= "a") modifies the string S to "aba". Therefore, print "aba".
S = "baddadda"
S1 = "dd"
S2 = "n"

modifyStrings(S, S1, S2);
banana
Changing the substrings S[2,3](Referring to characters from the 2nd and 3rd index of S) and S[5, 6] (= S1) to the string S2 (= "n") modifies the string S to "banana". Therefore, print "banana".


Strings + Arrays

Task 3
Given an array of email addresses, print the number of valid email addresses satisfying the following conditions.
a)  	Each email contains an ‘@’ character
b)  	There is at least one character  before and after ‘@’ character and it has to start with letter
c)  	There is a ‘.’ character after the character(s) after ‘@’ character
d)  	There is at least one character after ‘.’ character

Sample Input
Sample Output
email_list = {"abc@gmail.com", "!@cv.bd",  "123cse@bracu.ac.bd"}
1
email_list = {"cse110@gmail.com", "government@cv.",  "eee@bracu.ac.bd"}

Strings + Methods
Task 4
Write a method called isHappyNumber which takes an integer in its parameter to check whether a number is a happy number or not. If the number is a happy number then the method returns boolean true otherwise it returns boolean false. In number theory, a happy number is a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit. For instance, 13 is a happy number because 12 + 32 = 10 and 12 + 02  = 1. On the other hand, 4 is not a happy number because the process continues in an infinite cycle without ever reaching 1. Unhappy number ends in a cycle of repeating numbers which contains 4 .
Sample Input
Sample Output
boolean check = isHappyNumber(82)
System.out.println(check)
true
boolean check = isHappyNumber(4)
System.out.println(check)
false


Task 5
Write a method called toDecimal which takes a binary number as a string in its parameter to convert the binary number to its decimal number and return the decimal value. After returning the decimal value, write another method called toHex which takes the converted decimal value in its parameter and calculates the hexadecimal value and then return the hex value.
Sample Input
Sample Output
int decimal = toDecimal("1010")
String hex = toHex(decimal)
System.out.println(hex)
"A"


Task 7
You are given an integer array. You need to identify all the prime numbers and perfect numbers within the array and print the indices along with these numbers from the original array.
Sample Input
Sample Output
Sample Input:
int arr[] = {6, 13, 28, 17, 3, 9, 11, 23, 10, 29, 12, 7}
Prime Numbers: 
1: 13
3: 17
4: 3
6: 11
7: 23
9: 29
11: 7

Perfect Numbers:
0:  6
2: 28


Task 9
Your professor expects only As, Bs, and Cs. In the following program, write a method called getScores that takes as input corresponding arrays studentGrades and studentScores. Write a method called getScores that assigns index i in studentGrades based on index i in studentScores. If a grade is A, assign 100. If a grade is B, assign 90. If a grade is C, assign 70. If a grade is anything else, assign 0.

Sample Input
Sample Output
char[] studentGrades = new char[]{'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'U', 'Z'};
int[] studentScores = new int[7];
Output expectation:
100
100
100
90
70
0
0

Task 10
A. Write a method called convertToCm(), that takes as input a type double and returns the value converted from inches to centimeters.
Hint: There are 2.54 centimeters in an inch

Sample Method Call
Output
double t = convertToCm(16);
System.out.println(t + " cm");
40.64 cm



B. Create an array of type double of length 5 called cheetos_inches, that stores the length of each of the Cheetos from the user. Send the array of length in inches into a method called findAvgCm() that returns the average length of the Cheetos in cm to 2 decimal places. The method findAvgCm() uses convertTocm() to convert the length of each Cheetos from inches to cm. 
Note: You must call the method written in [Method Task A], otherwise this task would be considered invalid. 

Sample Method Call
Output
Sample array:
double [] cheetos_inches = new double[]{10.0, 12.0, 14.0, 16.0, 18.0};

averageLength = findAvgCm(cheetos_inches);

System.out.println("The average Cheeto length is "+ averageLength  +" cm");


The average Cheeto length is 35.56 cm



Arrays + Strings + Methods

Task 11
A. Write a method called isVowel which takes a string in its parameter and counts all the vowels in the String. If any vowel exists in the string then the method returns the count. 

Sample Input
Sample Output
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Number of vowels in the string: 11




B. Write a method called isConsonant which takes a string in its parameter and counts all the consonants in the String. If any consonant exists in the string then the method returns the count.
 
Sample Input
Sample Output
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Number of consonants in the string: 24





C. Write a method called vowel/consonantSum which takes an array of strings in its parameter and returns the summation of the number of vowels/consonants.
Note: You must call the methods written in tasks A/B, otherwise this task will be considered invalid.

Given Array
Sample Output
String [] names = {"Bob", "Alice", "Max", "Marry", "Rosy"};
System.out.println( "The total number of vowels in the array is:" + vowelSum(names));
System.out.println( "The total number of consonants in the array is:" + consonantSum(names));
The total number of vowels in the array is: 7 

The total number of consonants in the array is: 13
