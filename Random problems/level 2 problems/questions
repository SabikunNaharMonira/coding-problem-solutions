A year may be a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4.
Years that are divisible by 100 (century years such as 1900 or 2100) cannot be leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. 

Sample Input
2020
2001
1900
Output
2020 is a leap year
2001 is not a leap year
1900 is not a leap year

6. Write a program which asks the user to enter an integer. Then you have to check the input and based on that you have to print the following outputs. 

 If the input is negative, then print “Number is negative”
 If the input is zero, then print “Number is zero”
 If the input is positive and even, then print “Number is positive and even”
And if the input is positive and odd, then print “Number is positive and odd”
Sample Input
5
-2
0
Output
Number is positive and odd
Number is negative
Number is zero

7. Let’s consider the following piecewise function:
f(x)={ 2x, x<0 ; x+1, 0<=x<2 ; x^2-1, 2<=x<5 ; 3x^2+2 , x>=5}

output: 15
output: 302

8. Write a Java Program, that takes in a student ID as integer, and prints out the year and the session the student enrolled in.
Hints:
The first two digits denote the year the student got enrolled
The 3rd digit denotes the session Student joined(Spring→1,Summer→3,Fall→2) 


Sample Input
Output
16101307
Student Joined in Spring 16
19301307
Student Joined in Summer 19
20201307

11. 
A triangle has 3 sides. Write a program which asks the users for input. Based on the input, your program should output whether it is an Equilateral, Isosceles or Scalene. 

Equilateral triangle has three sides with equal length 
Isosceles triangle has 
two sides with equal length and another side is different
Scalene triangle has different lengths in each side

Sample Input
Output
5
2
4
This is a Scalene triangle
5
5

12. Suppose you are hired by Swapno. Now, your task is to create a Java program that will help the cashier calculate the change to be returned.
The program takes two inputs. First input is an integer number which is the amount of money to be paid in taka and the second integer is the amount of money the customer gave to the cashier. Your program should print the following:

If the customer gave more money than the actual amount, print change the cashier should return in notes and coins.
If the customer gave less money than the amount to be paid, then print the amount the customer needs to pay. 
Consider the following denomination for notes and coins in taka:
Notes: 100, 50, 20, 10. 
Coins: 5, 2, 1.
Sample Input                                          
Enter the amount the customer need to pay(Taka)
35
Enter the amount, customer gave(Taka)
53

Enter the amount the customer need to pay(Taka)
60
Enter the amount, customer gave(Taka)
500

Output
The returned amount is 18 taka.
100 taka note: 0
50 taka note: 0
20 taka note: 0
10 taka note: 1
5 taka coin: 1
2 taka coin: 1
1 taka coin: 1

The returned amount is 440 taka.
100 taka note: 4
50 taka note: 0
20 taka note: 2
10 taka note: 0
5 taka coin: 0
2 taka coin: 0
1 taka coin: 0

Write a Java program that reads three numbers and prints "All numbers are equal" if all three numbers are equal, "All numbers are different" if all three numbers are different and "Neither all are equal or different" otherwise.

Input the 2nd number: 2452
Input the 3rd number: 4532

Input the 1st number: 230
Input the 2nd number: 230
Input the 3rd number: 112

Output:
All numbers are different
Neither all are equal or different
