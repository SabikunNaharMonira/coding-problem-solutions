Methods

1. [A,B,C,D should be written in a single java file]

A. Write a method called evenChecker that takes an integer number as its argument and prints whether the number is even or odd inside the method.

Sample Method Call
Sample Output
evenChecker(10);
Even!!
evenChecker(17);
Odd!!


B. Write a method called isEven that takes an integer number as an argument and returns boolean true if the number is even otherwise returns boolean false.

Sample Method Call
Sample Output
boolean result = isEven(10);
System.out.println( result );
true
boolean result = isEven(17);
System.out.println( result );
false


C. Write a method called isPos that takes an integer number as an argument and returns boolean true if the number is positive otherwise returns boolean false.

Sample Method Call
Sample Output
boolean result = isPos(-5);
System.out.println( result );
false
boolean result = isPos(12);
System.out.println( result );
true


D. Write a method called sequence() that takes an integer in its parameter called n. Now, if n is positive then it prints all the even numbers from 0 to n, otherwise if n is negative it prints all the odd numbers from n to -1.

Note: You must call the methods from CW-1B and CW-1C, otherwise this task would be considered invalid.

Sample Method Call
Sample Output
Explanation
sequence(10);
0 2 4 6 8 10
Here, 10 is positive so 0,2,4,6,8,10 were printed.
sequence(-7);
-7 -5 -3 -1
Here, -7 is negative so -7,-5,-3,-1 were printed.
sequence(7);
0 2 4 6
Here, 7 is positive so 0,2,4,6 were printed
sequence(-8);
-7 -5 -3 -1
Here, -8 is negative so -7,-5,-3,-1 were printed.



2. [A,B,C should be written in a single java file]

A. Write a method called circleArea that takes an integer radius in its parameter and returns the area of the circle.
Note: area of a circle is r2

Sample Method Call
Sample Output
   double area = circleArea(5);
   System.out.println(area);
78.5398






B. Write a method called sphereVolume that takes an integer radius in its parameter and returns the volume of the sphere.
Note: volume of a sphere is 43r3

Sample Method Call
Sample Output
double volume = sphereVolume(5);
System.out.println(volume);
523.5987



C. Write a method called findSpace that takes two values in its parameters one is an integer diameter and another one is a String. Using the given diameter, this method should calculate the Area of a circle or the Volume of a sphere depending on the value of the second parameter. Finally, it should print the result inside the method.

Note: You must call the method written in task CW-2A & CW-2B, otherwise this task would be considered invalid.

Sample Method Call
Sample Output
findSpace(10,"circle");  
78.5398
findSpace(5,"sphere"); 
33.5103
findSpace(10,"square");
“Wrong Parameter”



3. Write a method called isPrime which takes an integer in its parameter to check whether a number is prime or not. If the number is prime then the method returns boolean true otherwise it returns boolean false.

Sample Input
Sample Output
boolean check = isPrime(7);
System.out.println(check);
true
boolean check = isPrime(15);
System.out.println(check);
false



4. Write a method called isPerfect which takes an integer in its parameter to check whether a number is perfect or not. If the number is perfect then the method returns boolean true otherwise it returns boolean false.

Sample Input
Sample Output
boolean check = isPerfect(6);
System.out.println(check);
true
boolean check = isPerfect(33);
System.out.println(check);
false



5. Write a method called calcTax that takes 2 arguments which are your age then your salary. The method must calculate and return the tax as per the following conditions:
No tax if you are less than 18 years old.
No tax if you get paid less than 10,000
7% tax if you get paid between 10K and 20K
14% tax if you get paid more than 20K

Sample Method Call
Output
Explanation
double t = calcTax(16,20000);
System.out.println(t);
0.0
Here, the age is less than 18 so 0 tax.

double t = calcTax(20,18000);
System.out.println(t);
1260.0
Here, the age is greater than 18 and income is between 10K-20K so tax is 7% of 18000 = 1260.
