1. Write a Java program that will take N integer numbers from the user and create an array of length N.  
Print the elements of the array with their indices. 
Take another integer input from the user, resize the array by length 1, and add the new integer value to the array. Print the resized array.
Sample Input
Sample Output
N = 5
Enter a number: 11
Enter a number: 22
Enter a number: 33
Enter a number: 44
Enter a number: 55
Enter another number: 101
The elements of the array are:
0: 11
1: 22
2: 33
3: 44
4: 55
After resizing the array:
11 22 33 44 55 101



     2. You are given an integer array with duplicate values. Write a Java program to update the array by replacing the duplicate values of the array with zero. Then print the updated array. [Your code should work for any given integer array]

Given Array
Sample Output
int arr [] = {9, -5, 7, 9, -5, 5, 7};
Before removing duplicates:
9 -5 7 9 -5 5 7
After replacing duplicates with 0:
9 -5 7 0 0 5 0




3. Write a Java program that asks the user for the length of an array and then creates an integer array of that length by taking inputs from the user. Then,	
Reverse the array by creating a new array of the same length and print it. (Out-of Place) 
Reverse the array without creating any new arrays and print it. (In-Place) 

Sample Input
Sample Output
Enter the length of the array: 5
Enter a number: 7
Enter a number: -31
Enter a number: 344
Enter a number: 97
Enter a number: 100
Reversed using a new array:
100 97 344 -31 7

Reversed the original array:
100 97 344 -31 7




4.  Take an integer N input from the user and create an integer array of N numbers by taking inputs from the user. Then, print the array. Next, modify the array by changing the positive numbers by 1 and the negative numbers by 0. If the element is zero, then it will be unchanged. Lastly, print the modified array.

Sample Input
Sample Output
N = 4 
3
4
-2
1 
Original array: 
 3  4 -2  1
After modifying: 
1 1 0 1
N = 3 
-4
0
 2 
Original array: 
-4 0  2
After modifying: 
0 0 1







5.  Write a Java program that will take N integer numbers from the user and create an array of length N. Take another number from the user and print the index of the number where it is found first. If not found then print ‘Element not found’. 
Note: Think about how to apply the concept of flag and break in this task.


Sample Input 1
N = 7
Enter a number: 45
Enter a number: 0
Enter a number: 17
Enter a number: 11
Enter a number: -34
Enter a number: -100
Enter a number: 17
17
Sample Input 2
N = 5
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 99
Enter a number: 23
Enter a number: -67
Enter a number: 34
55


Sample Output 1
17 is at index 2
Sample Output 2
Element not found




6.  Write a Java program that asks the user for the length of an array then creates a double data-type array of that length by taking inputs from the user. 
Then do the following:
Show the maximum element and its index from the array.
Show the minimum element and its index from the array.
Show the summation of all the elements from the array.
Show the average of all the elements from the array.

Sample Input
Sample Output
Enter the length of the array: 5
Enter a number: 7.5
Enter a number: -31.2
Enter a number: 344.0
Enter a number: 97.1
Enter a number: 100.4
Maximum element 344.0 found at index 2
Minimum element -31.2 found at index 1
Summation: 517.8
Average: 103.56


7.  You are given an integer array. You need to create a new array that will contain only the unique elements of the given array. Finally, print the new array. 
Given Array
Sample Output
int arr [] = {23,100,23,56,100};
Input array: 
23 100 23 56 100
New array:
23 100 56
int arr [] = {-5,10,-7,-5};
Input array: 
-5 10 -7 -5
New array:
-5 10 -7




8.  Write a Java program that will take input of two arrays and elements from the user and check whether the second array is a subset of the first array. A subset is a set that contains only elements found in the original set.  

Sample Input - 1
Sample Output - 1
Please enter the length of array 1: 5
Please enter the elements of the arr1:
5
3
2
72
8
Please enter the length of array 2: 3
Please enter the elements of the arr2:
5
3
72
Array 2 is a subset of Array 1. 


Sample Input - 2
Sample Output - 2
Please enter the length of array 1: 5
Please enter the elements of the arr1:
7
2
33
1
6
Please enter the length of array 2: 3
Please enter the elements of the arr2:
1
8
2
Array 2 is not a subset of Array 1.
