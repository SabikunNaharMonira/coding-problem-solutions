The Sum of odd Natural Numbers up to 5 terms is: 25


7. Write a Java program that will read 10 numbers from the user, and then print the first number, the sum of the first 2 numbers, the first 3 numbers, and so on up to the sum of 10 numbers. 

Sample Input/Output: (The purple numbers are input.)
Enter Number: 6
Sum = 6
Enter Number: 7
Sum = 13
Enter Number: 2
Sum = 15
Enter Number: 8
Sum = 23
Enter Number: 7
Sum = 30
Enter Number: 5
Sum = 35
Enter Number: 1
Sum = 36
Enter Number: -12
Sum = 24
Enter Number: 0
Sum = 24
Enter Number: 1
Sum = 25

5
10
20
25
35
40
  
9. Write a program in Java that asks the user for an integer input and counts the number of digits in the number. 
Hint: You may keep dividing the number by ten and count how many times this can be done until the number becomes 0.

Sample Input
Output
7546
Total digits = 4


10. Write a program in Java that asks the user for an integer input, and print the individual digits forward (From left to right). 

Sample Input
Output
32768
3, 2, 7, 6, 8


[Hint: First, count how many digits. Then calculate 10 to the power that (number of digits) minus 1.Say, 32768 has 5 digits, so you calculate 10 to the power 4 which is 10,000. 
Then divide 32,768 by 10,000 and thus you get 3
Take remainder of 32,768 by 10,000 and thus you get 2,768 
Then divide 10,000 by 10 to get 1,000

Then divide 2,768 by 1,000 and thus you get 2.
take remainder of 2,768 by 1,000 and thus you get 768
keep going on until there are no more digits left (zero!).

In short:
Part 1: First count digits, say 5 in this case for 32,768
Part 2: Then calculate 10 to the power 4 (5-1), that is 10,000.
Part 3: Then repeat the following three steps:
32,768 / 10,000 = 3
32,768 % 10,000 = 2,768
10,000/10 = 1,000

2,768 / 1,000 = 2
2,768 % 1,000 = 768
1,000/10 = 100

768 / 100 = 7
768 % 100 = 68
100/10 = 10

68 / 10 = 6
68 % 10 = 8
10/10 = 1

8 / 1 = 8
8 % 1 = 0
1/10 = 0


11. Write a Java program that will take an integer as input and - 
a) Find out if the number is a prime number or not.
b) Find out if the number is a perfect number or not.
[Prime Number: If a number has only two divisors, (1 and itself), then it is a prime number. Else, then it is not a prime number.
Perfect Number: A number is said to be a perfect number if the sum of its divisors, including 1 but not the number itself is equal to that number.]

Sample Input
6
Sample Output
6 is not a prime number
6 is a perfect number
